# Sanyam Munot – Portfolio

A minimal, modern portfolio website inspired by `abhinavxj.vercel.app`, built with plain **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## Structure

- `index.html` – main single-page layout (hero, about, projects, skills, contact).
- `styles.css` – styling, layout, and responsive design.
- `script.js` – small enhancements (smooth scroll to sections, dynamic year in footer).

## Running locally

You don’t need any build tools for this project.

1. Open the project folder:
   - `C:\Users\sanyam munot\Downloads\Portfolio`
2. Double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser  
   **or**
3. Serve with a simple local server (recommended for best experience):

   ```bash
   # Option 1: Python 3
   python -m http.server 8000
   # then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
   ```

## Customisation

- **Name & role**: edit the header and hero text in `index.html`.
- **Projects**: update the three project cards (title, description, tags, links) in the `#projects` section.
- **Skills**: change the tags in the `#skills` section.
- **Contact**:
  - Replace `youremail@example.com` with your real email.
  - Add your GitHub and LinkedIn URLs to the contact links.

## Deployment

You can deploy this easily on:

- Vercel
- Netlify
- GitHub Pages

Just upload the three files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`) and point your host to `index.html` as the entry file.
